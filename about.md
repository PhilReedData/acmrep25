# About the workshop

## Abstract
[RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) is a lightweight method to package research outputs along with their metadata. [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) provides metadata schemas to add structured metadata to webpages on Life Science. [Schemas.science](https://schemas.science/) extends this provision into non-bio domains. 

The combination of RO-Crates, Bioschemas and schemas.science make resources easy to navigate by machines, provide an unambiguous way for machines to access FAIR metadata and content in a single request, and reduce content-negotiation hassle that can give unpredictable results. 

This combination is of benefit for researchers and data providers whenever they want to improve FAIRability of their resources as they can support RO-Crate imports and align with Bioschemas specifications, making FAIR-compliant digital objects achievable with existing technologies such as Web Linking over HTTP.

The benefits of adopting RO-Crates are evident in a diverse range of applications. For example, *Five Safes RO-Crate* [https://w3id.org/5s-crate/](https://w3id.org/5s-crate/) specifies a profile of RO-Crate for the purpose of workflow execution in a distributed trusted research environment (TRE). The TRE-FX Project (delivered with HDR-UK) is providing safe, federated access to TREs, using the [Five Safes](https://www.gov.uk/data-ethics-guidance/the-five-safes-framework) RO-Crate standard.

Following a Bring Your Own Resource hands-on style, in this tutorial we will showcase how to use RO-Crates, and Bioschemas to improve FAIRability and will accompany attendees to apply the technologies to their own resources.


## Learning objectives

Following a Bring Your Own Resource hands-on style, in this tutorial we will showcase how to use RO-Crates and Bioschemas to improve FAIRability and will accompany attendees to apply the technologies to their own resources.

After completing the Bioschemas section of the tutorial, learners will be able to:

* Describe how schema.org and Bioschemas markup can be embedded to GitHub pages  
* Use schema.org and Bioschemas profiles on GitHub pages  
* Use schema and Bioschemas validators

After completing the RO-Crates section of the tutorial, learners will be able to:

* Construct an RO-Crate by hand using JSON  
* Describe each part of the Research Object  
* Use basic JSON-LD to create FAIR metadata  
* Connect different parts of the Research Object using identifiers

These learning outcomes are most relevant to the ACM reproducibility concepts, including: “Software and artifact packaging and container-related reproducibility methods”, “Data versioning and preservation”, and “Approaches for advancing reproducibility”.
