## Learning objectives

After completing the RO-Crates section of the tutorial, learners will be able to:

* Construct an RO-Crate by hand using JSON
* Describe each part of the Research Object
* Use basic JSON-LD to create FAIR metadata
* Connect different parts of the Research Object using identifiers


## Audience prerequisites

Before attending the RO-Crates section of the tutorial, learners should already have:

* Files and folder organization and using an editor/IDE
* Familiarity with JSON file format

This part of the tutorial is meant to be read along with the [RO-Crate specification](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/), which learners are suggested to browse in advance.
