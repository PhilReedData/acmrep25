## Welcome

Following a Bring Your Own Resource hands-on style, in this tutorial we will showcase how to use RO-Crates and Bioschemas to improve FAIRability and will accompany attendees to apply the technologies to their own resources. 
By "FAIRability", we mean the your ability to make your research data outcomes more closely follow the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/): Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. 
Many of the concepts covered today are implemented as part of larger systems, you would not normally take such a low-level, "manual" approach to marking up data. 
However, it helps to understand these concepts by first applying them directly, at a small scale.

We will start with a few warm-up questions using Mentimeter. Please go to [menti.com](https://menti.com) and enter the codes below to participate in the questions ([direct link](https://www.menti.com/alxd32bzopmh)).

Use the left and right arrows above to move between slides. For reference, the questions are:

- Where in the world is your institution?
- What domains (subjects) do you work in?
- What best describes your role?
  - Data Analyst, Data Steward, Researcher, Software Developer, Manager, Other
- Do you manage any of the following for your institution/group/project?
  - Computational facilities/services, Data repositories/archives, Software repositories/archives, Physical labs & instruments, Analytical data processing applications/pipelines, Coud services, None of these
- How confident are you using these tools? 
  - Bioschemas, schema.org, JSON-LD, RO-Crate, GitHub
  - Where 1 is 'Never heard of it', 5 is 'Very confident'


## Software needs for the tutorial

### GitHub account

Participants should prepare by ensuring they can access their own free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If you have not used GitHub for a while, you may need to configure two-factor authentication. 

- See the **Software Carpentry** page for guidance on [creating a GitHub account](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account).

### Text editor

You will need to use a text editor such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS). Any plain text editor will work, however, for a better experience, we recommend an IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (free and built on open source). VSCode will provide features such as syntax highlighting and formatting for JSON documents.
