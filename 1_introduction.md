## Software needs for the tutorial

### GitHub account

Participants should prepare by ensuring they can access their own free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If you have not used GitHub for a while, you may need to configure two-factor authentication. See the Software Carpentry page for guidance on [creating a GitHub account](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account).

### Text editor

You will need to use a text editor such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS). Any plain text editor will work, however, for a better experience, we recommend an IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (free and built on open source). VSCode will provide features such as syntax highlighting and formatting for JSON documents.
