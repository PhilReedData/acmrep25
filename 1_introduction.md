## Software needs for the tutorial

Participants should prepare by ensuring they can access their own free GitHub account. If they have not used GitHub for a while, they may need to configure two-factor authentication. 

You will need to use a text editor such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS). Any plain text editor will work, however, for a better experience, we recommend an IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (free and built on open source). VSCode will provide features such as syntax highlighting and formatting for JSON documents.
