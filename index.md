Website for the [ACM REP '25](https://acm-rep.github.io/2025/) Tutorial 1 "Improving FAIRability of your research outcomes with RO-Crates and Bioschemas", by:

- **Phil Reed**, Research Community and Training Manager, The University of Manchester (UK)
- **Abigail Miller**, Principal Software Engineer for JAX Data Science, The Jackson Laboratory (USA)

The instructors are adapting materials produced by **Stian Soiland-Reyes** and **Leyla Jael Castro**, with additional thanks to **Eli Chadwick**, **Alex Hambley** and **Doug Lowe**.

See the [about page](about) for abstract, learning objectives, intended audience, and audience prerequisites.

Overall, the format of the tutorial will be short presentations preceding hands-on code tutorials, followed by a group discussion to consolidate learning and establish next steps. 
In more detail, the two practical sessions will be delivered by a qualified Carpentries instructor and will follow their evidence-based pedagogy, designed especially for teaching technical concepts. 
There are exercises and clear signposting throughout. 
Slides-based presentations are limited to 15 minutes. 
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data to apply the concepts to, where the familiarity will aid with comprehension. 
There is a coffee break in the middle of the tutorial.

Special thanks to [Heath Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) (HDR UK) for supporting this tutorial.
HDR UK's mission is to unite the United Kingdom's health data to enable discoveries that improve people's lives. 
They are leading work to improve access to data by researchers to improve prevension, care and treatments, helping people lead longer, healthier lives. 
We will look at the how RO-Crates and FAIR data principles are supporting HDR UK's mission.
