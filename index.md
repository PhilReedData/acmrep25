Overall, the format of the tutorial will be short presentations preceding hands-on code tutorials, followed by a group discussion to consolidate learning and establish next steps. 
In more detail, the two practical sessions will be delivered by a qualified Carpentries instructor and will follow their evidence-based pedagogy, designed especially for teaching technical concepts. 
There are exercises and clear signposting throughout. 
Slides-based presentations are limited to 15 minutes. 
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data to apply the concepts to, where the familiarity will aid with comprehension. 
There is a coffee break in the middle of the tutorial.
